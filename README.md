# Deadlock Avoidance and Detection Algorithms – Operating Systems

## Project Objective
- Develop a code of **deadlocks**, which prevent sets of concurrent processes from completing their tasks.
- Present a number of different methods for **preventing or avoiding deadlocks** in a computer system.

## Deadlock
   A process requests resources; if the resources are not available at that time, the process enters a waiting state. Sometimes, a waiting process is never again able to change state, because the resources it has requested are held by other waiting processes. This situation is called a **deadlock**.

A deadlock can occur **if and only if** all four conditions hold simultaneously:
1. **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource cannot be shared.
2. **Hold & Wait:** Processes hold resources while requesting additional ones.
3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.
4. **Circular Wait:** There is a cycle of processes where each waits for a resource held by the next.
These are the four necessary conditions for deadlock.
